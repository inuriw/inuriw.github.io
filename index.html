			Even when I'm used for a long time<br>
			You get me through every dark night<br>
			I'm always gone, out on the go<br>
			I'm on the run and you're home alone<br>
			I'm too consumed with my own life<br>
			Are we too young for this?<br>
			Feels like I can't move<br>
			Sharing my heart<br>
			It's tearing me apart<br>
			But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
			Doing what I can, tryna be a man<br>And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
			I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
			I've been confused as of late (yeah)<br>
			Watching my youth slip away (yeah)<br>
			You're like the sun, you make me young<br>
			But you drain me out if I get too much<br>
			I might need you or I'll break<br>
			Are we too young for this?<br>
			Feels like I can't move<br>
			Sharing my heart<br>
			It's tearing me apart<br>
			But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
			Doing what I can, tryna be a man<br>
			And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
			I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
			I don't want to play this part, but I do<br>
			I feel young<br>
			I don't want to make this hard, but now I will<br>
			'Cause I'm stuck<br>
			Sharing my heart<br>
			It's tearing me apart<br>
			But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
			Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)<br>
			And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
			I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
			Sharing my head, mhm<br>
			Sharing my head, yeah<br>
			Sharing my head<br>
			Sharing my head<br>
			(Breaking down)<br>
			Sharing my heart<br>
			It's tearing me and suddenly I'm (breaking down)<br>
			It's tearing my mind<br>
			It's tearing my life
